\section{Conversation With Client}
\begin{itemize}
\item We will have a prototype on the IDHW server by next week
\item All notifications (timesheet not approved, etc.) will be via email.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If a user's (employee's) time sheet is denied, they will be sent an email asking them to fix it
	\item Email addresses are in Active Directory
\end{itemize}
\item Active Directory has a "company name" field that has employer info in it
\item Each division of IDHW will have their own unique list of work efforts
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no correlation between division name and PCA codes
	\item Marj will send us a list of divisions within IDHW so we can populate a database table
\end{itemize}
\item Manager or Admin will add work efforts to the system ahead of time
\item Weekly batch processing clarifications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Their scheduler will call an executable that we provide
	\item If it comes across an un-approved timesheet, an error will be thrown and a notification will be sent via email
	\item If timesheet is not approved by Monday morning, the manager/approver will be sent a reminder email
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
