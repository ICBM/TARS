\section{Login system}
\begin{itemize}
\item We aren't able to use Active Directory - it's only for Windows Server 2008
\item We're trying to use LDAP authentication instead
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Scott using Apache Directory Service
	\item Able to do queries and access the database normally, but can't make it work in C\#
	\item Client suggested using a packet sniffer to find the problem
	\item System should be easy to port to DHW's Active Directory system - well commented and modular
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Etc.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Unable to write to Active Directory, so we're going to need another table for task/user assignment
\item Possible future meeting with security team to iron out LDAP/AD specifics
\item No meeting next week due to Thanksgiving.
\end{itemize}
