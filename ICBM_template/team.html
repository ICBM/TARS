		<h2>Scott Beddall</h2>
		<img src="images/scott.png"  class="leftimg">
		My name is Scott Beddall, I was born and raised south of Seattle in a small town called Maple Valley. As long as I can remember I have been either working with computers or finding some way too use them for my own entertainment. I have played soccer competively for most of my life, and at one point considered playing college soccer as well. Unfortunately, a degree in the Engineering College does not find itself well suited to competitive sports, so I have focused all my attention on my Computer Science degree. After graduation I hope to find a great job in the Seattle area.

		<h2>Chaylo Laurino</h2>
			<img src="images/chaylo.png" class = "rightimg">
		My name is Chaylo Giovanni Laurino.  I was born in the small town of Cottonwood Idaho to James and Naomi Laurino.  In my youth a reveled in puzzles, history, and creative building toys such as Legos.  We moved several times which made forming long term friendships difficult so I tended to be something of a recluse.  Several stints in several Catholic Schools resulted in my tendency to question everything and toward seeking knowledge and understanding.  It wasn't until 5th and 6th grade that I finally formed two friendships that have lasted to this day, although those friends have drifted from each other.  I have always enjoyed technology and even recall my first experiences with computers.  I found them fascinating and still do.  I wish I could have learned more early on.  In High School I was finally able to take classes in Networking and Technical Support.  The later being my preferred career and the area I have the most work experience in.  I chose to Major in Computer Science because I enjoy computers as well as programming.  There is always something to learn and I see programming a puzzles to be solved.  I hope to round out my computer education with Technical Support and Networking certificates.  After graduation I will pursue a career in either programming or Technical Support.

I've been interested in computers pretty much all my life and this has resulted in my studying Computer Science at the University of Idaho. I plan to graduate at the end of this semester, and I hope to find a job somewhere in the industry before then.
