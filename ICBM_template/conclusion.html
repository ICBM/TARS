		<h2>Project Conclusion</h2><br>
			At the end of the first semester the TARS team turned over the following deliverables to be passed on to the next semester's team for completion; This Design Document, Client Requirement Documents, Meeting Minutes, Tutorials, Prototype Source Files, Requirements Summary, and our GitHub Repository. These are all available <a href="https://github.com/ICBM/TARS/tree/master/doc">here.</a><br>
			<br>
			This Design Document contains all of the conceptual and technical designs for this project.  It also includes various Client restrictions on software and platform for the project.  For further details please read it <a href="doc/ssd.pdf">here</a><br>
			<br>
			The <a href="doc/requirements.xls">Client Requirement Documents</a> outline the Client's desired functionality of the system.  It is broken down into six parts: PCA, Data, Reporting, View, Security, Navigation, and Workflow.  This document was provided to us by the Client.  It has been updated several times as requirements have been added or altered.<br>
			<br>
			All of the Minutes of our meetings with our clients as also been added.  They show the changes in the requirements over time and contain clarifications to questions the client may have had during the course of the project.<br>
			<br>
			Extensive trial and error was involved in setting up our machines to be viable development platforms based on the restrictions laid out by the Client.  To prevent the next team from having to deal with the same problems already dealt with, the TARS development team has created several <a href="https://github.com/ICBM/TARS/tree/master/doc/Tutorials-Resources">tutorials</a> to help smooth the process.<br>
			<br>
			A functioning prototype has also been produced.  It includes all the primary models and controllers but has only rudimentary views and testing.  The source code has been provided as has a Microsoft Visual Studio solution.  The full details concerning the functional state of the prototype in relation to the full project requirements are laid out in the Requirements Summary document as well as the Requirements section of this document.<br>
			<br>
			The Requirements Summary is a combination of the Client Requirement Document and a full summary of our prototypes functionality.  It explains in detail the current status of every requirement.<br>
			<br>
			The final deliverable is the TARS GitHub Repository.  It has been the primary location for all collaborative work.  It is an open source repository as the client desired to make the source code open-source.  Maintaining private collaborators costs twelve dollars a month and will need to be transferred to the new team as soon as they take up the project.<br>
			<br>
			Our GitHub is online! <a href="http://www.github.com/ICBM/TARS">GitHub</a>
