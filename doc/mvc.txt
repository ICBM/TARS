Model-View-Controller

Software architecture

Advantage of Model-View-Controller architecture:
-Seperates the user interface from the logic used in the database.
-Allows for independant development, testing, and maintenance of these seperate parts of the application.

Consists of three parts:
Model - Manages data and behavior
View - Renders Model's data as a user interface
Controller - Receives input from the user and converts it to instructions for the Model and View components
