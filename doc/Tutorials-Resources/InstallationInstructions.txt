How-to install IIS on Windows 7:
	1. Goto Control Panel -> Turn Windows Features on and off
	2. Select Internet Information Services and mark all features to install.
		- Will need Application Development Features (all) and 
		- Basic HTTP Services(all), at a minimum.
	3. Browse to http://localhost and you should now see a default page
		- Located at C:/inetpub/wwwroot/iisstart.html
	4. Create a file called helloworld.aspx in the web root containing:
		- <html><%response.write("Hello world")%></html>
	5. Go to http://localhost/helloworld.aspx. If it displays "Hello world", IIS is working with ASP support.

Installing the SQL server:
	1. Install SQL Management Studio from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=7593
		- Go to Installation -> New SQL Server standalone...
		- On the feature screen, select everything. "Management Tools - Basic" is a MUST.
		- Continue with default settings.
	2. Install SQL Server Express from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=1695
		- Name for server: MSSQLSERVER
		- On Database Engine Configuration, enter Mixed Mode, with username 'user', password 'pw'.
	3. Open the SQL Server Configuration Manager (Start->AllPrograms->MS SQL Server 2008->Config)
		- Select protocols for the server. Enable TCP/IP.
	4. Open the SQL Server Management Studio. (Start->AllPrograms->MS SQL Server 2008)
		- Select Databases and add a new one called icbmdb
		- Go to Security->Logins and add a new one (user, pw)
		- Follow instructions on the linked webpage to setup a Connection String named MyString.
	5. Place the aspx.aspx file (in the same folder as this doc) in your web root and navigate to http://localhost/aspx.aspx
		- If it displays the number 5, it is correctly writing to and reading from your DB. Victory!
		- If it does not, threaten it with Google-fu.
